## Set up Git

At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.
To use Git on the command line, you'll need to download, install, and configure Git on your computer. You can also install GitHub CLI to use GitHub from the command line. For more information on [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/), see the GitHub CLI documentation.

```c++
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
	return 0;
}

```

If you want to work with Git locally, but don't want to use the command line, you can instead download and install the GitHub Desktop client. For more information, see "Installing and configuring GitHub Desktop."

If you don't need to work with files locally, GitHub lets you complete many Git-related actions directly in the browser, including:
* Creating a repository
* Forking a repository
* Managing files
* Being social

####  [Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git)

When you connect to a GitHub repository from Git, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH.

####  [Connecting over HTTPS (recommended)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#connecting-over-https-recommended)

If you [clone with HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-remote-repositories/#cloning-with-https-urls), you can [cache your GitHub credentials in Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git) using a credential helper.

####  [Connecting over SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git#connecting-over-ssh)

If you [clone with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-remote-repositories/#cloning-with-ssh-urls), you must [generate SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.
